```

## Purrr Package

The **`purrr`** package in R is part of the **`tidyverse`**, a collection of R packages designed for data science. It provides a functional programming toolkit to simplify many common data manipulation tasks. The package aims to make your code more readable, more maintainable, and easier to reason about by allowing you to use functions as first-class objects.

Here's a quick overview of some of the key functionalities:

1.  **Mapping Functions**: **`map()`**, **`map_df()`**, **`map_dbl()`**, etc. apply a function to each element of a list or vector and return results in various forms (list, data frame, double, etc.).

2.  **Predicate Functions**: Functions like **`keep()`**, **`discard()`**, etc., help to filter elements from a list based on a condition.

3.  **Functional Programming Tools**: **`compose()`**, **`partial()`**, etc., help in function composition and creating partial functions.

4.  **Iteration Functions**: **`walk()`**, **`walk2()`**, etc., allow you to iterate over multiple arguments in lists.

5.  **Reduction Functions**: **`reduce()`**, **`accumulate()`**, etc., help to reduce a list to a single value by iteratively applying a function.

## **1. The basics of purrr**

To get started, map is the workhorse function of the purrr package. map and apply basically take on the tasks of a for loop. Suppose we wanted to accomplish the following task.

```{webr}
genes <- paste0("Gene", 1:10)
genes
```

Let's make a `for` loop through this vector and print the genes.

```{webr}
for (i in seq_along(genes)){
  
  print(genes[i])
  
}

```

**For Loop**:

It takes elements one by one from a vector called **`genees`** and then applies the **`print()`** function to them. In this case, the loop iterates over the indices of the **`genes`** .

-   **Step 1**: **`i = 1`** -\> **`print(genes[1])`**

-   **Step 2**: **`i = 2`** -\> **`print(genes[2])`**

-   **\...**

-   **Step n**: **`i = n`** -\> **`print(genes[n])`**

Rather than use a loop, we could accomplish the same task using `lapply` . What we are doing here is applying the function `print` over each of the elements in `genes` .

```{webr}
print_genes <-  lapply(genes, print)
```

And lastly using `map` from `purrr`

```{webr}
genes_map <-  map(genes, print)
```

**Purrr's map**: The **`genes_map <- map(genes, print)`** could be represented as a single operation that applies **`print()`** to each element of **`genes`** and returns a new list **`genes_map`**.

**Single Operation**: **`map(genes, print)`** -\> Returns **`genes_map`**

```{webr}
class(genes_map)
```

### **1.1 Mapping Functions**

#### **`map()`**

Now that we have an idea of what `map` does, let's dig into it a bit more.

The basic syntax works in the manner:

-   `map("vector to apply function to","Function to apply across vectors","Additional parameters")`

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
Three ways to pass functions to `map()`

1.  pass directly to `map()`

2.  use an `anonymous function`

3.  use `~`
:::

The **`map()`** function applies a function to each element of a list or vector, and return a list.

These two figures below explains how `map` works

[source](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-basics.html)

Let's practice.

```{webr}
# Double each element in the vector
double_it <- function(x) x * 2
map(1:5, double_it)
```

While we are discussing return types, let's introduce some of the other `map` functions. They are:

-   `map_dbl()`: Returns a `numeric` vector.

-   `map_int()`: Returns an `integer` vector.

-   `map_lgl()`: Returns a `logical` vector.

-   `map_chr()`: Returns a `character` vector.

-   `map_df()`: Returns a `data frame` .

### Exercice1

Your task is to explore other **`map`** variants that return different types of output. Specifically, try to guess and then verify which of the following functions you can use other than `map`:

1.  **`map_int`**

2.  **`map_dbl`**

3.  **`map_chr`**

4.  **`map_lgl`**

5.  **`map_df`**

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## **Questions**

1.  Which **`map`** variant should you use if you want the output to be a numeric vector?

2.  What happens if you use **`map_int`** with the **`double_it`** function? Is the output as expected?

3.  Can you use **`map_chr`** or **`map_lgl`** with the **`double_it`** function? What happens?

4.  What is the utility of each **`map`** variant based on the type of output they produce?
:::

Let's respond to the question 1 and 2.

```{webr}
# let's try
double_it <- function(x) x * 2
map_int(1:5, double_it)
map_dbl(1:5, double_it)
```

Let's respond to the question 3 and 4.

```{webr}
double_it <- function(x) x * 2
map_lgl(1:5, double_it)
map_chr(1:5, double_it)
```

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## **Solution**

1.  We can use `map_int` or `map_dbl` because it returns a numeric value.

2.  Using **`map_int`** or `map_dbl` in this particular case would work as expected.

3.  You should not use **`map_chr`** or **`map_lgl`** with the **`double_it`** function, as the output of **`double_it`** is numeric. Using **`map_chr`** or **`map_lgl`** would throw an error because these functions expect the output to be of character or logical types, respectively.

4.  Each variant is designed to make it clear what type of output you should expect, making the code more readable and robust.
:::

#### `map2()`

The **`map2`** function from the **`purrr`** package in R is used to apply a function to pairs of elements from two lists or vectors. The function takes three main arguments:

-   **`.x`**: The first list or vector

-   **`.y`**: The second list or vector

-   **`.f`**: The function to apply

Both **`.x`** and **`.y`** should have the same length, and the function **`.f`** is applied to corresponding elements from **`.x`** and **`.y`**.

The figure below explains how `map2` works.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-10-05%20at%202.42.26%20PM.png)

[source](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-parallel.html)

Here's an example to illustrate how **`map2`** works. Let's say we have two numeric vectors **`vec1`** and **`vec2`**, and we want to multiply corresponding elements from these vectors.

```{webr}
# Define two numeric vectors
vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
vec2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Define a function to multiply two numbers
multiply_int <- function(x, y) {
  return(x * y)
}
```

Give me the corresponding `map` function to this for loop

```{webr}
# Initialize an empty numeric vector to store the results
result <- numeric(length(vec1))

# Loop through the vectors and apply the function multiply_int
for (i in seq_along(vec1)) {
  result[i] <- multiply_int(vec1[i], vec2[i])
}

# Print the result
print(result)
```

Use **`map2`** to multiply corresponding elements from **`vec1`** and **`vec2`**.

```{webr}
# Use map2 to apply the function
result <- ---(---, ---, ---)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

Just like the **`map`** function has several variants to produce different types of output (**`map_dbl`**, **`map_int`**, **`map_chr`**, etc.), **`map2`** also has similar variants:

-   **`map2_dbl`**: Returns a numeric vector.

-   **`map2_int`**: Returns an integer vector.

-   **`map2_chr`**: Returns a character vector.

-   **`map2_lgl`**: Returns a logical vector.

-   **`map2_df`**: Returns a data frame.

These variants work the same way as **`map2`**, but they simplify the output to a specific type instead of a list.

#### `pmap()`

The **`pmap`** function is used when you have `more than two lists or vectors` and you want to apply a function to corresponding elements from each list or vector.

#### Example 1

Let's create an example where we have three vectors, and we want to find the sum of corresponding elements from these vectors.

```{webr}
# Define three numeric vectors
vec1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
vec2 <- c(4, 5, 6)
vec3 <- c(7, 8, 9)
```

We'll first put them into a list.

```{webr}
# Create a list containing the vectors
list_of_vecs <- list(vec1, vec2, vec3)
```

We'll define a function to find the sum of corresponding elements.

```{webr}
# Define a function to find the sum of three numbers
sum_it <- function(x, y, z) {
  return(x + y + z)
}

```

and we'll apply this function to these vectors using **`pmap.`**

```{webr}
# Use pmap to apply the function
result <- pmap_dbl(list_of_vecs, sum_it)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

In this example, **`pmap_dbl`** will return a numeric vector containing the sums of corresponding elements from **`vec1`**, **`vec2`**, and **`vec3`**.

The **`pmap`** function in the **`purrr`** package also has variants similar to **`map`** and **`map2`**, designed to simplify the output to a specific type:

-   **`pmap_dbl`**: Returns a numeric vector.

-   **`pmap_int`**: Returns an integer vector.

-   **`pmap_chr`**: Returns a character vector.

-   **`pmap_lgl`**: Returns a logical vector.

-   **`pmap_df`**: Returns a data frame.

This figure explains how `pmap` works.

#### Example2

Let's say you have a list of data frames, and each data frame has the same structure---two columns named **`A`** and **`B`**. You want to create a new column `Sum` in each data frame, which is the sum of columns **`A`** and **`B`**.

First, let's create a list of data frames:

```{webr}
# Create three data frames
df1 <- tibble(A = c(1, 2, 3), B = c(4, 5, 6))
df2 <- tibble(A = c(7, 8, 9), B = c(10, 11, 12))
df3 <- tibble(A = c(13, 14, 15), B = c(16, 17, 18))

# Create a list of data frames
list_of_dfs <- list(df1, df2, df3)
```

Now, let's use **`pmap`** to create the new column **`Sum`** in each data frame:

```{webr}
# Function to add a new column sum = A + B
add_column_Sum <- function(df) {
  df %>% mutate(Sum = A + B)
}

# Use pmap to apply the function to each data frame
new_list_of_dfs <- pmap(list_of_dfs, add_column_Sum)

# Show the first data frame in the new list to see the added column C
print(new_list_of_dfs[[1]])

```

Why are we getting an error?

::: callout-tip
-   When you have multiple lists (or vectors) and a function that can operate on multiple arguments, you can pass the lists directly to **`pmap`**.

-   When you have a single list (or a list of data frames) and a function that operates on a single argument, you need to wrap the list in another list to pass it to **`pmap`**.
:::

#### `imap()`

The **`imap`** function in **`purrr`** is used to iterate over both the elements and their indices in a list or vector. The function takes two arguments: the first is the element, and the second is the index. This can be very useful when you want to perform operations that depend on the index as well as the value of each element.

Let's say we have a list of sequences and you want to label each sequence with a unique identifier based on its position in the list.

```{webr}
# Create a list of DNA sequences
dna_sequences <- list(
  "ATCG",
  "GCTA",
  "TTAA",
  "CCGG"
)

# Use imap to add a unique identifier to each sequence
sequences_with_ids <- imap(dna_sequences, ~ tibble(sequence = .x, id = paste0("seq_", .y)))

# Print the modified list of sequences with identifiers
print(sequences_with_ids[[1]])
```

In this example, each string in **`dna_sequences`** represents a DNA sequence:

-   **`.x`** refers to the DNA sequence itself.

-   **`.y`** refers to the index of that sequence in the list.

We use **`imap`** to create a tibble for each sequence that contains the sequence itself and a unique identifier **`id`**, which is generated based on its index in the original list (using **`paste0("seq_", .y)`**).

The result is a list of tibbles, each containing a DNA sequence and its unique identifier, which could be useful for downstream analyses or for merging with other datasets.

Let's see another example.

In gene expression analysis, we often work with transcripts per million (TPM) values for different genes across various samples. Calculating a normalized expression metric like $GeneExp=log⁡(TPM)+1GeneExp=log(TPM)+1$ is a common practice.

Suppose we have three vectors:

1.  **`genes`** contains the names of genes: **`"Gene1", "Gene2", "Gene3"`**

2.  **`tpm_values`** contains TPM values for these genes: **`10, 20, 30`**

3.  **`samples`** contains the names of samples: **`"Sample1", "Sample2", "Sample3"`**

We'll calculate the GeneExp value for each gene in each sample.

```{webr}
library(purrr)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)

# Function to calculate GeneExp
calculate_gene_exp <- function(gene, tpm_value, sample) {
  gene_exp <- log(tpm_value) + 1
  return(tibble(Gene = gene, Sample = sample, GeneExp = gene_exp))
}

genes <- c("Gene1", "Gene2", "Gene3")
tpm_values <- c(10, 20, 30)
samples <- c("Sample1", "Sample2", "Sample3")

# Use pmap_df to apply the function across all combinations
result <- pmap_df(list(genes, tpm_values, samples), calculate_gene_exp)

# Display the result
print(result)
```

#### `other mapping f()`

`map_if()`,`map_at()`: Apply only to certain elements.

`walk` : for side effects like plotting; return input invisibly.

## Intermediate level

In bioinformatics, one common task is to perform some type of analysis on different sets of genes across multiple samples. Let's consider a scenario where we have RNA-seq data from different samples and different gene sets that we're interested in. We'll simulate this data for the demonstration.

We'll simulate some RNA-seq data for 10 genes across 3 samples. We'll define two gene sets Set1 and Set2 that we're interested in.

```{webr}
# Simulated RNA-seq data: 10 genes x 3 samples
rna_seq_data <- data.frame(
  Gene = paste0("Gene", 1:10),
  Sample1 = runif(10, 0, 100),
  Sample2 = runif(10, 0, 100),
  Sample3 = runif(10, 0, 100)
)

# Two example gene sets with different lengths
gene_sets <- list(
  Set1 = c("Gene1", "Gene3", "Gene5"),
  Set2 = c("Gene2", "Gene4", "Gene6", "Gene7")
)

```

We want to do the following for each gene set and each sample:

1.  Filter the genes in the sample that belong to the gene set.

2.  Calculate the average expression level of these genes.

3.  Log-transform the average to get a single value representing each gene set's activity in each sample.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## **Task**
Use `map_dfr` to loop over each gene set. Inside this, we use `map_dbl` to loop over each sample. For each gene set and each sample, call the `calculate_average_and_log` function. The final result is a tidy data frame with the average log-transformed expression level for each gene set in each sample.
:::

## Solution
```{webr}
# Function to calculate average expression and then log-transform it
calculate_average_and_log <- function(df, gene_set) {
  filtered_data <- df %>% 
    filter(Gene %in% gene_set) %>% 
    select(-Gene) %>% 
    pull()
  avg_exp <- mean(filtered_data, na.rm = TRUE)
  return(log(avg_exp + 1))
}

# Nested map functions to perform the analysis
results <- map_dfr(names(gene_sets), function(set_name) {
  gene_set <- gene_sets[[set_name]]
  sample_results <- map_dbl(names(rna_seq_data)[-1], function(sample_name) {
    sample_data <- rna_seq_data %>% select(Gene, all_of(sample_name))
    calculate_average_and_log(sample_data, gene_set)
  })
  tibble(GeneSet = set_name, !!!set_names(sample_results, names(rna_seq_data)[-1]))
})

# Pivoting to make it tidy
results_tidy <- results %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -GeneSet, names_to = "Sample", values_to = "LogAvgExp")

results_tidy
```
